## GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

__Language__

Papers can be written in Portuguese, English, or Spanish.

__Length__

We accept submissions of long and short papers. Long papers should
describe complete work with significant results. Short papers can
report work in progress, negative results, opinion papers, or
application papers. Long papers may have up to eight (8) pages of
content (including tables and pictures), with two (2) additional pages
of references, and will be presented orally. Short papers should have
up to four (4) pages of content, and one (1) additional page of
references, and will be presented as posters. Authors should also
indicate whether they accept their long paper to be reallocated as a
poster should the reviewers recommend so.

__Format__

Paper formatting must follow the SBC guidelines available at this address: http://bit.ly/2jFbJTa 

__Reviewing Process__

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least two experts in the
field. The reviewing will be double blind and therefore papers should
not display any information regarding their authorship in the header
or body of the text. Self-references that reveal the author’s
identity, e.g., “As we previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”, must be
avoided. Instead, authors such use “Silva previously showed (Silva,
2005)…”.

__Submission Policy__

By submitting papers to STIL 2017, the authors agree that in case of
acceptance at least one author registers to the conference and
presents the paper. Furthermore, it is the conference policy that at
least one of the authors of accepted papers has to register *before*
the deadline for sending the camera-ready paper. Accepted papers
without the respective author registration *before* the deadline will
not be included in the online proceedings.
